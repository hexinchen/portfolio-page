# portfolio-page
My very first web project. A simple portfolio page using HTML/CSS. User can scroll down by clicking the buttons on menu. Result is like this : https://codepen.io/hexi2015/full/MEBbqp/


User Story:

1. I can view a tribute page with an image and text.

2. I can click on a link that will take me to an external website with further information on the topic.
